# tweetHack

tweetHack will edit a tweet composed of slightly more than 140 characters and abbreviate words to make tweet 140 characters.

App will shorten ONLY english words. App will use standard abbreviation i.e. can not = can't. When standard abbreviations aren't available the app will shorten words by removing vowels.

'phonetic concatenation' - the removal of vowels in a word to reduce the numbers of letters in a word while having the same phonetic pronunciation

Twitter no longer includes the length of links within the 140 character limit.

Hash tags and @mentions will not be altered.

If after multiple iterations the tweet can not be shortened enough to fit in the 140 character limit, the tweet will be kicked back to the composer for edit.

Not sure which API's will be used.
